Fashion Product Recommendation System
Overview
This project implements an advanced Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model for an e-commerce fashion product recommendation system. The system is trained on a dataset of 15,000 diverse fashion product images.

Features
Model Architecture: Utilizes the ResNet50 architecture for detailed feature extraction from images.
Recommendation Algorithm: Implements the k-nearest neighbors (KNN) algorithm to identify similar products based on feature proximity.
Enhanced User Experience: Enhances e-commerce platforms by providing personalized product recommendations to users, improving their shopping experience.
Increased Sales: Boosts sales by suggesting related products, creating cross-selling opportunities, and increasing customer engagement.
Inventory Management: Aids in inventory management by identifying popular trends in product preferences, allowing for more effective stock management.
Marketing Impact: Personalized recommendations drive marketing engagement and conversion rates, contributing to a more dynamic, customer-centric shopping experience.
Usage
Data Preparation: Ensure the fashion product image dataset is prepared and organized.
Model Training: Train the CNN model using the provided dataset.
Model Evaluation: Evaluate the performance of the trained model using appropriate metrics.
Integration: Integrate the trained model into your e-commerce platform for personalized product recommendations.
