# Fashion Product Recommendation System

## Overview
This project implements an advanced Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model for an e-commerce fashion product recommendation system. The system is trained on a dataset of 15,000 diverse fashion product images.

## Features
- **Model Architecture**: Utilizes the ResNet50 architecture for detailed feature extraction from images.
- **Recommendation Algorithm**: Implements the k-nearest neighbors (KNN) algorithm to identify similar products based on feature proximity.
- **Enhanced User Experience**: Enhances e-commerce platforms by providing personalized product recommendations to users, improving their shopping experience.
- **Increased Sales**: Boosts sales by suggesting related products, creating cross-selling opportunities, and increasing customer engagement.
- **Inventory Management**: Aids in inventory management by identifying popular trends in product preferences, allowing for more effective stock management.
- **Marketing Impact**: Personalized recommendations drive marketing engagement and conversion rates, contributing to a more dynamic, customer-centric shopping experience.

## Usage
1. **Data Preparation**: Ensure the fashion product image dataset is prepared and organized.
2. **Model Training**: Train the CNN model using the provided dataset.
3. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluate the performance of the trained model using appropriate metrics.
4. **Integration**: Integrate the trained model into your e-commerce platform for personalized product recommendations.
